Hello! This is my Spotify Weather App. 

I made this to familiarize myself with using APIs, and also because I thought it'd be interesting to try something completely unique. 


What this program does is asks for an zip input, and will give you songs based off the "mood" of the weather


I've gotten shockingly great results out of it, and I use it daily personally.
